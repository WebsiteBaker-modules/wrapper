// a placeholder file only
/*
in this folder you can place library files for your addon.
some little rules:

naming conventions:
- use prefix "m_AddonName_FunctionName()"
- use '.lib' as only one extension inside this folder
coding hints:
- take care for sideeffects. place functions or classes here only
- do not declare variables outside of functions/classes
- do not declare constants outside of classes
- do not place executable code outside of functions/classes
